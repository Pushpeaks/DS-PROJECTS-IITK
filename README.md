Data Analytics Projects - IIT Kanpur Summer Training
This repository houses a collection of data analytics projects I developed during the E & ICT Academy, IIT Kanpur's Summer Training Program on Python for Data Science. These projects demonstrate my practical skills in leveraging Python for comprehensive data analysis, manipulation, and advanced visualization.

Key Highlights:
Robust Data Analysis: Projects involve various stages of the data analytics pipeline, from data acquisition and cleaning to exploratory data analysis (EDA) and drawing actionable insights.

Effective Data Manipulation: Demonstrations of using powerful Python libraries for efficient data handling and transformation.

Insightful Data Visualization: Creation of static and interactive visualizations to clearly communicate trends, patterns, and discoveries within data.

Problem-Solving Focus: Each project addresses a specific problem, showcasing my ability to apply analytical techniques to derive solutions.

Jupyter Notebooks: All projects are presented in well-documented Jupyter Notebooks, ensuring clarity, reproducibility, and easy exploration of the code and findings.

Projects include:
Advanced Book Scraper: A data acquisition project using Beautiful Soup to efficiently scrape book information from various online sources.

Quiz Management System: An analytics solution built with Python Streamlit for an interactive frontend and SQLite3 for robust backend data management, demonstrating data storage and retrieval capabilities.


Technologies Used:
Python 3.x

Core Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Other Libraries (as needed): Scikit-learn (for any basic ML aspects within analytics), Plotly (for interactive visualizations), Beautiful Soup (for web scraping), Streamlit (for web applications), SQLite3 (for database management)

Setup:
To get started with these projects, ensure you have Python 3.x installed. It's recommended to create a virtual environment:

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install required libraries
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter scikit-learn plotly beautifulsoup4 streamlit sqlalchemy

Usage:
Navigate into each project's directory to find its dedicated Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file) and an accompanying README.md (if present) for a detailed overview, objectives, and execution steps.

Contributing:
While these are primarily portfolio projects, constructive feedback, suggestions, or bug reports are always welcome! Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
